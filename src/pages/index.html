      <span class="text-center">We know you have so many things to do every day. And on top of going to work, getting
        the mail, doing the laundry, feeding the dog/the cat/the kids/yourself—there are so many things to care
        about.</span>
      <spacer size="20"></spacer>
      <span class="text-center">Injustice. Poverty. Pollution. The future of humanity! The list goes on and on and never
        ends.</span>

      <span class="text-center">It’s easier to do nothing. To say that you can’t commit to doing anything, because you
        can’t possibly do everything.</span>

    <span class="text-center">It may not seem like much. But choosing to take action, no matter how big or small, takes guts. It matters. To us, and to the 13 million people who will have clean and safe water because you decided to do something about the global water crisis.</span>
      <spacer size="20"></spacer>
      <span class="text-center">These are people like <a href="#">Helen</a> and her community in Uganda. Like <a href="#">Honorine</a>, her family, and the patrons at her restaurant in Madagascar. Like <a href ="#">Netra</a> and his classrooms full of students in Nepal. Since 2006, you’ve helped fund more than <strong>78,000 water projects</strong> that continue to change the lives of people in <strong>29 countries</strong> around the world.</span>
